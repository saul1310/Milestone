#  XML Processing Tasks

My project contains eight Python scripts (`task1.py` to `task8.py`) that perform various XML processing operations such as formatting, tag analysis, and element modification.

---

##  Requirements

- **Python 3.8+** installed  
- A valid XML file (for example: `test.xml`)

---

##  How to Run Each Task

Open a terminal in the project directory (`Milestone-1`) and run the following command:

```bash
python taskx.py test.xml
```

where x is the number 1-8 of the task you wouild like to run.

I ran the code on a 1 gb file, and it worked! it took about 10 minutes to compile.
